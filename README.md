A simple Computer Vision project to recognize colors by clicking on images.
Uses Euclidean Distance to calculate minimum distance between pixel shade and color values from CSV file.
Future modifications include using ML-based classifier algorithms to train models for color recognition.

Run "python color_detection.py -i <image_path>" to start interactive session.<br>
Double click anywhere and as many times on the image to view color name and RGB values.<br>
Press Ctrl + C on the python file command line to exit session.
